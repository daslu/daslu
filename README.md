Daniel Slutsky, a mathematician and a data-science consultant

## Projects
* co-organizing the [Scicloj community](https://scicloj.github.io/), where Clojure developers collaborate on building a few core projects of the emerging Clojure data stack
* organizing [Jointprob](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/jointprob/), a study community for Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming 

* co-maintaining the following repos:
  * [ClojisR](https://github.com/scicloj/clojisr) - a bridge from Clojure to R
  * [Notespace](https://github.com/scicloj/notespace) (on hold) - a literate programming and data visualization tool - has been used in the community for a couple of years, and served as a test bed of multiple variations of the "namespace as a notebook" idea
  * [Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly) - a common ground for Clojure literate programming
  * [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/) - a continuation of some of the Notespace ideas, a minimalistic Kindly-compatible tool for data visualization and literate programming
  * [Viz.clj](https://scicloj.github.io/viz.clj/) - a proof-of-concept exploration of data visualization APIs
  * [The Scicloj website](https://github.com/scicloj/scicloj.github.io)
