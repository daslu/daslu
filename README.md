  * [ClojisR](https://github.com/scicloj/clojisr) - a bridge from Clojure to R
  * [Notespace](https://github.com/scicloj/notespace) (on hold) - a literate programming and data visualization tool - has been used in the community for a couple of years, and served as a test bed of multiple variations of the "namespace as a notebook" idea
  * [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/) - a continuation of some of the Notespace ideas, creating a compatibility layer with other relevant tools 
  * [Viz.clj](https://scicloj.github.io/viz.clj/) - a work-in-progress exploration of data visualization APIs
  * [The Scicloj website](https://github.com/scicloj/scicloj.github.io)
